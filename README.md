### ❓ FAQ

#### 🚪 Why should I open a project under Tech Phantoms?

A. Firstly, when you open a project under Tech Phantoms you retain all the rights of your project. As it is open-source anyone can use your code for free. However, you need to manage and take decisions for your project. You can transfer back your repository to your account at any time. You also have to manage your sponsorship. 

Tech Phantoms staff helps you bring new potential contributors to your issue, not disclosing how we do that, we have something on our mind. We will host weekly YouTube live sessions where we bring you as a maintainer to talk about your project, its roadmap, and how can the first-time contributors get started. Your project will grows and you will get an awesome community feeling. 🎉

#### 🚫 What if I create a project and I stop maintaining?

No worries, we won't ever ask any maintainer to take away their project, the development will be at your pace. We will create an automatic system where if your project is actively maintained you will have better support.
