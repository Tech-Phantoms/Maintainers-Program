### ❓ FAQ ❓

#### 🚪 Why should I open a project under Tech Phantoms?

A. Firstly, when you open a project under Tech Phantoms you retain all the rights of your project. As it is open-source anyone can use your code for free. However, you need to manage and take decisions for your project. You can transfer back your repository to your account at any time. You also have to manage your sponsorship.

Your project will grows and you will get an awesome community feeling. 🎉
