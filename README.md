But you get to manage and take decisions for your project, Also you can transfer back your repository at any time, you also manage your sponsorship.

Tech Phantoms staff helps you bring new potential contributors to your issue, not disclosing how we do that, we have something on our mind wink . We host weekly youtube live sessions where we bring you as a maintainer to talk about your project, its roadmap and how can the first-time contributers get started.

#### What if I create a project then I don't maintain it?

No worries, we won't ever ask any maintainer to take away their project the development will be at your pace. We will create an automatic system where if your project is actively maintained you will have better support.
